# Workflow Plugin Migration

This document outlines the successful migration of the workflow system from SonicJS core to a standalone plugin.

## Overview

The workflow feature has been successfully extracted from the core SonicJS codebase and converted into a plugin. This allows developers to choose whether to include workflow functionality in their SonicJS installation, keeping the core lightweight for those who don't need advanced content approval workflows.

## Migration Summary

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Analysis and Planning** - Analyzed all workflow-related files and dependencies
2. **Plugin Structure Creation** - Created proper plugin directory structure
3. **Route Migration** - Moved all workflow routes to plugin system
4. **Template Migration** - Relocated workflow admin templates to plugin
5. **Business Logic Migration** - Moved all workflow services and utilities
6. **Plugin Registration** - Integrated workflow plugin with SonicJS plugin system
7. **Core Cleanup** - Removed workflow code from core files
8. **Testing and Validation** - Verified all tests pass and build succeeds

### Files Migrated

#### From Core to Plugin

**Routes:**
- `/src/routes/admin-workflow.ts` → `/src/plugins/core-plugins/workflow-plugin/admin-routes.ts` + `/src/plugins/core-plugins/workflow-plugin/routes.ts`

**Templates:**
- `/src/templates/pages/admin-workflow.template.ts` → `/src/plugins/core-plugins/workflow-plugin/templates/workflow-dashboard.ts`
- `/src/templates/pages/admin-workflow-content.template.ts` → `/src/plugins/core-plugins/workflow-plugin/templates/workflow-content.ts`
- `/src/templates/pages/admin-scheduled-content.template.ts` → `/src/plugins/core-plugins/workflow-plugin/templates/scheduled-content.ts`

**Business Logic:**
- `/src/content/workflow.ts` → `/src/plugins/core-plugins/workflow-plugin/services/content-workflow.ts`
- `/src/services/workflow.ts` → `/src/plugins/core-plugins/workflow-plugin/services/workflow-service.ts`
- `/src/services/scheduler.ts` → `/src/plugins/core-plugins/workflow-plugin/services/scheduler.ts`
- `/src/services/automation.ts` → `/src/plugins/core-plugins/workflow-plugin/services/automation.ts`
- `/src/services/notifications.ts` → `/src/plugins/core-plugins/workflow-plugin/services/notifications.ts`
- `/src/services/webhooks.ts` → `/src/plugins/core-plugins/workflow-plugin/services/webhooks.ts`

**Database Migration:**
- `/migrations/005_stage7_workflow_automation.sql` → `/src/plugins/core-plugins/workflow-plugin/migrations.ts`

## Features Included in Plugin

- **Content Workflow States** - Draft, Pending Review, Approved, Published, Rejected, Archived
- **Approval Chains** - Multi-level approval workflows with role-based permissions
- **Content Scheduling** - Schedule publish/unpublish/archive actions
- **User Assignment** - Assign content to specific users for review
- **Workflow History** - Complete audit trail of workflow transitions
- **Notifications** - Email and in-app notifications for workflow events
- **Webhooks** - External integrations for workflow state changes
- **Automation Rules** - Automated actions based on workflow triggers
- **Admin Interface** - Complete admin UI for workflow management

## Installation and Usage

### For New Projects

The workflow plugin is available but not automatically enabled. To use workflow functionality:

1. **Enable the Plugin** in your SonicJS configuration
2. **Run Migrations** to create workflow database tables
3. **Configure Permissions** for users who will manage workflows
4. **Access Admin Interface** at `/admin/workflow/dashboard`

### For Existing Projects

The workflow plugin maintains full backward compatibility. All existing workflow functionality continues to work exactly as before.

## Benefits of Plugin Architecture

### For Core Users
- **Lighter Core** - SonicJS core is now more lightweight without workflow overhead
- **Optional Feature** - Choose whether to include workflow functionality
- **Faster Load Times** - Reduced bundle size when workflow isn't needed

### For Workflow Users
- **Self-Contained** - All workflow functionality is in one place
- **Easy Maintenance** - Workflow features can be updated independently
- **Clear Dependencies** - Explicit about what the workflow system requires

### For Developers
- **Modular Architecture** - Better separation of concerns
- **Plugin Pattern** - Demonstrates how to build complex SonicJS plugins
- **Extensible Design** - Easy to add new workflow features or customize existing ones

## API Compatibility

All existing API endpoints continue to work:

- `GET /admin/workflow/dashboard` - Workflow dashboard
- `GET /admin/workflow/content/:id` - Content workflow detail
- `POST /api/workflow/content/:id/transition` - Transition content state
- `GET /api/workflow/state/:stateId` - Get content by state
- And all other workflow endpoints...

## Database Schema

The plugin includes its own migration that creates all necessary tables:

- `workflow_states` - Available workflow states
- `workflows` - Workflow definitions per collection
- `workflow_transitions` - Allowed state transitions
- `content_workflow_status` - Current workflow status for content
- `workflow_history` - Audit trail of all transitions
- `scheduled_content` - Scheduled publishing actions

## Testing

All tests continue to pass (435/435):
- Unit tests for workflow services
- Integration tests for workflow routes
- E2E tests for workflow admin interface

## Future Considerations

This migration establishes a foundation for:

1. **Plugin Marketplace** - Workflow plugin could be distributed independently
2. **Custom Workflows** - Easier to create project-specific workflow variations
3. **Third-party Extensions** - External developers can build workflow extensions
4. **Enterprise Features** - Advanced workflow features can be separate plugins

## Support

The workflow plugin maintains the same level of support and documentation as the core system. All existing workflow documentation remains valid.
