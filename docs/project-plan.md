## Getting Started

To begin development:

1. **Review AI Instructions**: Read `docs/ai-instructions.md` thoroughly
2. **Set Up Environment**: Follow Stage 1 setup instructions
3. **Create Feature Branch**: Use `feature/stage-1-foundation` naming
4. **Implement Stage**: Work through todo items systematically
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Run all tests before stage completion
6. **Review & Merge**: Conduct code review before moving to next stage

Each stage should be completed and thoroughly tested before proceeding to the next. This ensures a solid foundation and reduces technical debt.
